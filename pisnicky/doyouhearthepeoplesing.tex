\refrain{
Do you \chord{C}hear the people sing, singing the \chord{F}song of angry \chord{C}men,\\
it is the \chord{Am}music of a \chord{D}people, who will \chord{G}not be slaves again!\\
When the \chord{C}beating of your \chord{C\7}heart echoes the \chord{F}beating of the \chord{C}drums,\\
there is a \chord{Am}life about to \chord{Dm}start when to\chord{G\7}morrow \chord{C}comes. \chord{H\7}

\vers{1}{
Will you \chord{Em}join in our crusade, who will be \chord{Hm}strong and stand with me\\
be\chord{Am}yond the barricade is there a \chord{Em}world you long to see,\\
then \chord{C}join in the fight, that will \chord{Am\7}give you the right to be \chord{D}free!

\refrain{
Do you \chord{G}hear the people sing, singing the \chord{C}song of angry \chord{G}men,\\

Will you give all you can give, so that our banner may advance,\\
some will fall and some will live, will you stand up and take the chance?\\
The blood of the martyrs will water the meadows of France!
