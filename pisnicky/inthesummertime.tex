\vers{1}{
In the \chord{A}summertime, when the weather is high,\\
you can stretch right up and touch the sky,\\
when the \chord{D}weather's fine, you got women, you got women on your \chord{A}mind.\\
Have a \chord{E}drink, have a drive, \chord{D}go out and see what you can \chord{A}find.
}


\vers{2}{
If her daddy's rich, take her out for a meal,\\
if her daddy's poor, just do what you feel.\\
Speed along the lane, do a ton or a ton and twenty five.\\
When the sun goes down, you can make it, make it good in a lay-by.
}

\vers{3}{
We're not bad people, we're not dirty, we're not mean,\\
we love everybody, but we do as we please.\\
When the weather's fine, we go fishing or go sailing in the sea.\\
We're always happy, life's for living, yeah, that's our philosophy.
}

\vers{4}{
Sing along with us, di di di di di,\\
da da da da da, yeah, we're hap happy.\\
Da da da, di da da di da da, da da da\\
da da da da da, da da da da da.
}

\vers{5}{
When the winter's here, yeah, it's party time,\\
bring a bottle, wear you bright clothes, it'll soon be summertime.\\
And we'll sing again, we'll go driving or maybe we'll settle down.\\
If she's rich, if she's nice, bring your friends and we'll all go into town.
