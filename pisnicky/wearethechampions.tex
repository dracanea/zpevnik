\vers{1}{
I've paid my \chord{Am}dues, \chord{Em}\nc time after \chord{Am}time, \chord{Em}\\
I've done my \chord{Am}sentence, \chord{Em}\nc but committed no \chord{Am}crime. \chord{Em}\\
And bad mis\chord{C}takes, \chord{F\maj\bas{C}}\nc\nc I've made a \chord{C}few, \chord{F\maj\bas{C}}\\
I've had my \chord{C}share of sand \chord{G}kicked in my \chord{Am}face, but \chord{D}I've come \chord{G}through!\\
(And the beat will go on and on and on and \chord{A}on.)

\refrain{
\chord{D}We are the \chord{F\kk m}champions, my \chord{Hm}friends, \chord{G}\nc\chord{A}\\
and \chord{D}we'll keep on \chord{F\kk m}fighting till the \chord{G}end! \chord{H\7}\\
\chord{Em}We are the champions, \chord{Gm}we are the \chord{C\kk\dm}champions\\
\chord{D}no time for \chord{C}losers, 'cause \chord{F}we are the \chord{G}champions \chord{G\6\bas{A}}\nc of the \chord{Dm}world! \chord{G\bas{D}}\nc\chord{Dm}\nc\chord{G\6\bas{A}}

\vers{2}{
I've taken my bows and my curtain calls.\\
You've brought me fame and fortune and everything, that goes with it,\\
I thank you all.\\
But it's been no bed of roses, no pleasure cruise,\\
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race and I ain't gonna lose!\\
(Where the beat just goes on and on and on and on.)
