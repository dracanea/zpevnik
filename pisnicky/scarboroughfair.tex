\chord{Am}Are you going to \chord{G}Scarborough \chord{Am}fair?\\
Par\chord{C}sley, \chord{Am}sage, rose\chord{C}ma\chord{D}ry and \chord{Am}thyme.\\
Re\chord{Am}member \chord{C}me to one, \chord{G\bas{H}}who \chord{Am}lives \chord{G}there,\\

\vers{2}{
Tell her to make me a cambric shirt.\\
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme.\\
Without no seams nor needle work,\\
and then she'll be a true love of mine.
}

\vers{3}{
Tell her to find me a acre of land.\\
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme.\\
Between salt water and the sea strands,\\
then she'll be a true love on mine.
}

\vers{4}{
Tell her to reap it in a sickle of leather.\\
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme.\\
And gather it all in a bunch of heather,\\
then she'll be a true love of mine.
}

\vers{5}{
Are you going to Scarborough fair?\\
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme.\\
Remember me to one, who lives there,\\
for once she was a true love of mine.
