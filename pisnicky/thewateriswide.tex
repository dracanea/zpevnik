\vers{1}{
The water is \chord{E}wide \chord{A}I can't cross \chord{E}over\\
and neither\chord{C\kk m} \sm\sm I \mm\chord{F\kk m}have wings to \chord{H}fly,\\
\chord{H\7}give me a \chord{G\kk m}boat, \chord{A}that can carry \chord{G\kk m}two\\
\chord{A}and both shall \chord{H\4}row, \chord{H}my love and \chord{E}I. 
}

\vers{2}{
Now love is gentle and love is kind,\\
the sweetest flower when first it's new,\\
but love grows old and waxes cold\\
and fades away like morning dew.
}

\vers{3}{
There is a ship she sails the sea,\\
she's loaded deep as deep can be,\\
but not as deep as the love I'm in,\\
I know not how I sink or swim.
}

\vers{4}{
The water is wide I can't cross over\\
and neither I have wings to fly,\\
give me a boat, that can carry two\\
and both shall row, my love and I.
