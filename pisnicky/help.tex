\vers{1}{
\chord{A}When I was younger, so much \chord{C\kk m}younger than today,\\
\chord{F\kk m}I never needed anybody's \chord{D}help in \chord{G}any \chord{A}way.\\
\chord{A}But now, those days are gone, I'm \chord{C\kk m}not so self-assured.\\

\vers{2}{
And now my life has changed in, oh, so many ways!\\
My independence seemed to vanish in the hase.\\
But every now and then I feel so insecure,\\
I know, that I just need you like I've never done before.
