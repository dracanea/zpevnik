\vers{1}{
All my \chord{C}bags are packed, I'm \chord{F}ready to go.\\
I'm \chord{C}standing here out\chord{F}side your door,\\
I \chord{C}hate to wake you \chord{Am}up to say good\chord{G}bye.\\
But the \chord{C}dawn is breaking, it \chord{F}is early morn,\\
the \chord{C}taxi is waiting, he is \chord{F}blowing his horn,\\
al\chord{C}ready I'm so \chord{Am}lonsome, I could \chord{G}die.
}

\refrain{
So \chord{C}kiss me and \chord{F}smile for me, \chord{C}tell me, that you'll \chord{F}wait for me.\\
\chord{C}Hold me like you'll \chord{Am}never let me \chord{G}go. 'Cause I'm \chord{C}leavin' \chord{F}on a jet plane\\
\chord{C}don't know when \chord{F}I'll be back again. \chord{C}\nc Oh \chord{Em}babe, I hate to \chord{G}go!
}

\vers{2}{
There is so many times I've let you down,\\
so many times I've played around.\\
I tell you now they don't mean a thing.\\
Every place I'll go I think of you\\
every song I sing I'll sing for you.\\
When I come back, I'll bring your wedding ring.

\vers{3}{
Now the time has come to leave you,\\
one more time let me kiss you.\\
Then close your eyes, I'll be on my way.\\
Dream about the days to come,\\
when I wont have to leave alone,\\
about the times, I wont have to say:
