\vers{1}{
\chord{E}I once had a girl, or should I say, \chord{D}she once \chord{A}had \chord{E}me?\\
\chord{E}She showed me her room, isn't it good, \chord{D}norwe\chord{A}gian \chord{E}wood?
}

\refrainn{1}{
She \chord{Em}asked me to stay and she told me to sit any\chord{A}where.\\
So \chord{Em}I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a \chord{F\kk m}chair. \chord{H}
}

\vers{2}{
I sat on a rug, binding my time, drinking her wine.\\
We talked until two, and then she said, it's time for bed.
}

\refrainn{2}{
She told me, she worked in the morning and started to laugh.\\
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath.
}

\vers{3}{
And when I awoke, I was alone, this bird had flown.\\
So, I lit a fire, isn't it good norwegian wood?
