\intro{
Now \chord{Am\7}somewhere in the Black Mountain Hills of Dakota,\\
there lived a \chord{D\7\4}young boy name of Rocky Racc\chord{D\7}oon\\
and \chord{G\7}one day his woman ran of with a\chord{C}nother guy,\\
\chord{C\bas{H}}hit young Rocky in the \chord{Am\7}eye. Rocky didn't like that, he said \enquote*{I'm \chord{D\7}going to get that boy.}\\
So one \chord{G\7}day he walked into town and booked himself a room in the \chord{C}local saloon.

\chord{Am\7}Rocky Raccoon checked \chord{D\7}into his room \chord{G\7}only to find Gideon's \chord{C}Bible.\chord{C\bas{H}}\\
\chord{Am\7}Rocky had come eq\chord{D\7}uipped with a gun to \chord{G\7}shoot off the legs of his \chord{C}rival.\chord{C\bas{H}}\\
His \chord{Am\7}rival, it seems, had \chord{D\7}broken his dreams by \chord{G\7}stealing the girl of his \chord{C}fancy.\chord{C\bas{H}}\\
Her \chord{Am\7}name was Magill, and she \chord{D\7}called herself \enquote{Lil}, but \chord{G\7}everyone knew her as \chord{C}Nancy.\chord{C\bas{H}}

\vers{2}{
Now, she and the man, who called himself Dan were in the next room in the hoedown.\\
Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin, he said, \enquote*{Danny, boy, this is a showdown.}\\
Bud Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot and Rocky collapsed in the corner.

\vers{3}{
Now, the doctor came in, stinking of gin and proceeded to lie on the table.\\
He said, \enquote*{Rocky, you met your match.}, but Rocky said \enquote*{Doc, it's only a scratch\\
and I'll be better\dots I'll be better, doc, as soon as I am able.}
}

\vers{4}{
Now, Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room only to find Gideon's bible.\\
Gideon checked out, and he left it no doubt to help with good Rocky's revival.
