\vers{1}{
In Penny \chord{D}Lane: there is a \chord{Hm}barber showing \chord{Em\7}photographs \chord{A\7}\\
of every \chord{D}head he's had the \chord{Hm}pleasure to \chord{Dm\7}know.\\
And all the \chord{H\hdm}people that come and \chord{B}go, stop and \chord{A\7}say hello.\chord{(G\7)}
}

\vers{2}{
On the corner is a banker with a motor car,\\
the little children laugh at him behind his back\\
and the banker never wears a mac in the pouring rain. Very strange.
}

\refrainn{1}{
Penny \chord{C}Lane is in my \chord{Em\7}ears and in my \chord{F}eyes,\\
\chord{C}there beneath the \chord{Em\7}blue suburban \chord{F}skies.\\
I sit and \chord{A\7}meanwhile back
}

\vers{3}{
in Penny Lane: there is a fireman with an hour glass\\
and in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.\\
He likes to keep his fire engine clean, it's a clean machine.
}

\refrainn{2}{
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.\\
A four of fish and finger pies\\
in summer meanwhile back
}

\vers{4}{
behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout\\
the pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray\\
and though she feels as if she's in a play, she is anyway.
}

\vers{5}{
In Penny Lane: the barber shaves another customer.\\
We see the banker sitting, waiting for a trim.\\
And then the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain. Very strange.
