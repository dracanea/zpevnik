Tell her to make me a cambric shirt.\\
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme.\\
Without no seam noe needlework\\
and then she'll be a true love of mine.

\vers{3}{
Tell her to find me an acre of land.\\
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme.\\
Between the salt water and the sea strand\\
and then she'll be a true love of mine.
}

\vers{4}{
Tell her to plough it with a lamb's horn.\\
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme.\\
And to sow it all o'er with one peppercorn\\
and then she'll be a true love of mine.
}

\vers{5}{Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather.\\
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme.\\
And to trash it all out with a bunch of heather\\
and then she'll be a true love of mine.
