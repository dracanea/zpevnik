\song{Big Bang Theory Theme}
\sub{ze seriálu Teorie velkého třesku}

\vers{1}{
Our \chord{C}whole uni\chord{D}verse was in a \chord{G}hot \chord{D\bas{F\kk}}dense \chord{Em}state,\\
then nearly fourteen billion years ago expansion started, wait\dots\\
The Earth began to cool, the autothrops began to drool,\\
Neanderthals developed tools,\\
we built a wall.(We built the pyramids!)\\
Math, science, history, unraveling the mysteries,\\
that all started with the big bang!
}

\vers{2}{
"Since the dawn of man"\sm is realy not that long,\\
as every galaxy was formed in less time, than it takes to sing this song.\\
A fraction of a second and the elements were made,\\
the bipeds stood up straight, the dinosaurs all met their fate,\\
they tried to leap, but they were late\\
and they all died. (They froze their asses off.)\\
The oceans and Pangea, 
see ya, wouldn't wanna be ya\\
set in motion by the same big bang.\\
It \chord{C}all started \chord{D}with the big \chord{Am\7}bang!
}

\bridge{
\chord{D}It's ex\chord{G}panding ever \chord{Em}outward but one \chord{Am\7}day\\
\chord{D}it will \chord{G}cause the stars to \chord{Em}go the other \chord{Am\7}way,\\
collapsing \chord{D}ever inward, \chord{Am\add{7}}we won't be here, \chord{D}it won't be hurt.\\
\chord{Am\7}Our best and \chord{G\bas{B}}brightest figure, that \chord{C}it'll make an \chord{D}even bigger bang!
}

\vers{3}{
Australopithecus would really have been sick of us,\\
debating how we're here, they're catching deer. (we're catching viruses)\\
Religion or astronomy, Descartes or Deuteronomy,\\
it all started with the big bang.\\
\vinv
Music and mythology, Einstein and astrology,\\
it all started with the big bang.\\
It all started with the big bang!
