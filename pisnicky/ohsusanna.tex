\vers{1}{
I've \chord{D}come from Alabama with my banjo on my \chord{A\7}knee,\\
I'm go\chord{D}ing to Louisiana, my true love \chord{A\7}for to \chord{D}see.\\
It \chord{D}rained all night the day I left, the weather was \chord{A\7}dry,\\
the \chord{D}sun so hot I froze to death, Susanna, \chord{A\7}don't you \chord{D}cry.

\refrain{
\rep{\chord{G}Oh, Susanna, oh, \chord{D}don't you cry for \chord{A\7}me,\\
I've \chord{D}come from Alabama with my banjo \chord{A\7}on my \chord{D}knee.}
}

\vers{2}{
I had a dream the other night, when everything was still,\\
I thought I saw Susanna dear a comming down the hill.\\
The red, red rose was in her hand, the tear was in her eye,\\
I said \enquote{I'm comming from the south, Susanna, don't you cry!}
