\vers{1}{
\chord{D}Sally called, when she got the word,\\
\chord{G}she said \enquote{I suppose you've heard \chord{A}about \chord{D}Alice. \chord{A\7}}\\
Well I \chord{D}rushed to the window and look outside,\\
\chord{G}but I could hardly believe my eyes,\\
\chord{A}as a big limousine rolled up into \chord{D}Alice's drive. \chord{A\7}
}

\refrain{
Oh, I \chord{D}don't know, why she's leaving or where she's gonna go,\\
I \chord{G}guess she's got her reasons, but I just don't want to know\\
'cause for \chord{A}twenty-four years I've been living next door to \chord{D}Alice. \chord{A\7}\\
\chord{D}Twenty-four years just waiting for a chance,\\
to \chord{G}tell her how I'm feeling, maybe get a second glance,\\
now I've \chord{A}got to get used to not \chord{G}living next \chord{A}door to \chord{D}Alice
}

\vers{2}{
Grew up together, two kids in the park,\\
carved our initials deep in the bark, me and Alice.\\
Now she walks through the door with her head held high,\\
just for the moment, I caught her eye,\\
as a big limousine pulled slowly out of Alice's drive.
} \refsm{}

\vers{3}{
Sally called back, asked how I felt,\\
she said \enquote{I know, how to help get over Alice.}\\
She said \enquote{Now Alice is gone, but I'm still here,\\
you know I've been waiting for twenty-four years}\\
and the big limousine disappeared.
}

\refrain{
\dots\\
But I'll never get used to not living next door to Alice.
