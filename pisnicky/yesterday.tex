\chord{C}Yesterday, \chord{Hm\7}all my \chord{E\7}troubles seemed so \chord{Am}far away, \chord{G}\nc\chord{F}\\
now it \chord{G}looks as though they're \chord{C}here to stay,\\
oh \chord{Am}\sm I\sm be\chord{D\7}lieve in \chord{F}yester\chord{C}day.

\vers{2}{
Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be,\\
there's a shadow hanging over me,\\
oh yesterday came suddenly

\chord{E}Why \chord{E\add{7}}she \chord{Am}had \chord{G}to \chord{F}go, \chord{Am}I don't \chord{Dm\7}know, she \chord{G\7}wouldn't \chord{C}say\\
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.
