\vers{2}{
Together they would travel on a boat with billowed sail,\\
Jackie kept a lookout perched on Puff's gigantic tail.\\
Noble kings and princes would bow whenever they came,\\
pirate ships would lower their flag when Puff roared out his name.

\vers{3}{
A dragone lives forever, but not so little boys,\\
painted wings and giant rings make way for other toys.\\
One grey night it happened, Jackie Paper came no more\\
and Puff, that mighty dragon, he ceased his fearless roar.

\vers{4}{
His heas was bent in sorrow, green scales fell like rain,\\
Puff no longer went to play along the cherry lane.\\
Without his life-long friend Puff could not be brave,\\
so Puff, that mighty dragon, sadly slipped into his cave.
