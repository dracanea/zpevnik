\vers{1}{
I'd \chord{Am}rather be a sparrow, than a \chord{C}snail, yes, I would, if I could, I surely \chord{Am}would. Hm.\\
I'd \chord{Am}rather be a hammer, than a \chord{C}nail, yes, I would, if I only could, I surely \chord{Am}would. Hm.
}

\refrain{
A \chord{F}way, I'd rather sail away, like a \chord{C}swan, that's here and gone.\\
A \chord{F}man gets tied up to the ground, he gives the \chord{C}world its saddest sound,\\
its saddest \chord{Am}sound.

\vers{2}{
I'd rather be a forrest, than a street, yes, I would, if I could, I surely would.\\
I'd rather feel the earth beneath my feet, yes, I could, if I only could, I surely would. Hm.
